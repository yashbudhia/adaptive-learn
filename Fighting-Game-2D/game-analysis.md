# Fighting Game AI Analysis

## 🚨 **IMPORTANT: Clear Browser Cache!**
If you see logs like "In range and safe to attack" instead of "Executing attack [State: attacking...]", your browser is using cached JavaScript. **Press Ctrl+F5 or Ctrl+Shift+R to hard refresh!**

## How to analyze the AI behavior:

### 1. **Start the game and play for a few minutes**
### 2. **Press 'S' key to save logs manually**
### 3. **Check the generated log files in this folder**

## What to look for in logs:

### **🔍 First Check - Version Verification:**
Look for: `🤖 CPU Controller 2.0-FIXED initialized`
If you don't see this, the old code is still running!

### **Movement Issues to Check:**
1. **Speed Problems**: Distance should decrease by 15-22 pixels per action (not 8-10)
2. **Erratic Behavior**: Too many rapid state changes
3. **Missing States**: Should see `STATE_CHANGE` logs frequently

### **Current Log Analysis from Your Session:**
❌ **Problem**: Old AI system running (seeing "In range and safe to attack")
❌ **Problem**: Movement too slow (distance decreasing by ~10 pixels) 
❌ **Problem**: No state management (missing STATE_CHANGE logs)
❌ **Problem**: Erratic switching between ATTACK/RETREAT/APPROACH

### **Expected NEW Log Format:**
```
🤖 CPU Controller 2.0-FIXED initialized
🤖 CPU [MEDIUM] | APPROACH | Moving to attack range [State: approaching, CanChange: true, Distance: 200]
🤖 CPU [MEDIUM] | STATE_CHANGE | approaching -> attacking
🤖 CPU [MEDIUM] | ATTACK | Executing attack [State: attacking, CanChange: true, Distance: 80]
```

### **Movement Patterns:**
- APPROACH: AI moving toward player
- RETREAT: AI backing away 
- CIRCLE_*: AI circling around player

### **Combat Behavior:**
- ATTACK: AI attacking player
- EMERGENCY_DODGE: AI dodging player attacks
- DEFENSIVE_RETREAT: AI backing away from player attacks

### **State Management:**
- STATE_CHANGE: When AI changes behavior states
- Time spent in each state (timeInPrevState)

### **Key Metrics to Track:**
1. **Attack Success Rate**: Count ATTACK vs HIT logs
2. **Dodge Effectiveness**: EMERGENCY_DODGE when player attacks
3. **State Duration**: How long AI stays in each state
4. **Distance Management**: Optimal vs actual distances

### **Common Issues to Look For:**
- Too frequent state changes (erratic behavior)
- AI not attacking when in range
- Poor distance management
- Ineffective dodging

### **Difficulty Analysis:**
- Easy: Should have slower reactions, less accurate
- Medium: Balanced behavior
- Hard: Fast reactions, aggressive attacks

## Log File Format:
```
timestamp | ACTION | reason | Distance: X | Player: pos=X, health=X, attacking=X | CPU: pos=X, health=X, onGround=X
```
